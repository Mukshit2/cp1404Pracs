# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Mukshit


> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  The travel tracker project (assignment 2) took me approximately one week to complete. This included familiarizing myself with the requirements and specifications, planning and designing the program structure, writing and testing the code, and making any necessary revisions.
## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
...Requirements and step by step explanantion of mark sheet were really helpfull.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
...At first i was in hurry to complete the assignment and i was unable to cope up with requirements.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
...had a defined development process that provide a sense of structure and direction, reducing uncertainty and increasing confidence in my work. This helped me feel more in control and better equipped to handle challenges or unexpected changes.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
...In the next assignment, I plan to spend more time planning and designing my code upfront to ensure that it is more modular and easier to test. I will also look for ways to incorporate automated testing tools into my workflow to help catch bugs earlier and reduce the amount of time spent on manual testing.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
...Python documentation: The official Python documentation is a great resource to learn about the language's syntax, built-in functions, and standard library.
GitHub: GitHub is a code hosting platform where you can store and share your code with others. You may have used this platform to collaborate with others on your Python 

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
... There were several challanges that i faced but the most foremost was time management. I took a week to do this assignment but if did the time management i would have done early. I really faced difficulty in this part as i was not aware of this phenomena properly.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
...
Classes improve code by encapsulating related data and functions into a single unit. This allows for better organization, abstraction, and modularity, which in turn makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain. Classes also provide the ability to create multiple instances of the same object, each with its own set of data, allowing for more efficient and scalable programming.
